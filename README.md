# Podcast-Website-Template

This repo is a project meant to allow podcast hosts to create their on websites for their podcasts using this React Project as a template/ starting point. Follow the the instruction to get it setup.

## Intial Setup

1. Fork this repo to the Github account you want to host the website from
2. Go into src\components\values.js and src\components\credentials.js and and replace all the links, Spotify API keys, etc. (You can get the spotify keys, etc by going to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login and following the steps to sign up and create an app. This will generate you the required information (ClientId, ClientSecret) and for the showID simply go to the spotify page for your podcast and get the alphanumeric id at the end of the URL)

## Custom Styling

- Custom styling will require some knowledge of css and html.
- You will need to go into the designated styling sheet and replace any colors with the desired color of your choice.

## Adding Pages

1. Go into src\components\pages\values.js and add any page links that you intend on adding this will automatically add it to the navbar. (Note that if you add too many pages you may have to adjust sizing for it to fit on the navbar)
2. Go into App.js and add the component you created for that page as a < Route /> with the correct correct link.

## Hosting using Github Pages

## Information About React: Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
